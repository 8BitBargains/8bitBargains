## General notes

- Consider user stories for the sake of clarity
- Use more description, more assignment
- Make the README your own
- Standardize your commit messages, for example [this one](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages)
- Make sure to have consistent code style (spacing, semicolons)! Should be part of reviewing code before a pull request
- Watch out for unvalidated user inputs (e.g. `req.body` when creating a user)
